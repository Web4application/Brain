## 🧩 Overview
**Brain** is a modular, Python-based AI engine designed to simulate cognitive reasoning, adaptive memory, and learning behavior.  
It acts as the *core neural logic layer* for Web4 Application projects — powering analytics, automation, and intelligent decision-making.

The architecture emphasizes scalability, modularity, and clean data flow — bridging human-like reasoning with machine-level precision.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 🧠 Adaptive reasoning engine  
- 🔁 Modular architecture for AI components  
- 🗂️ In-memory + persistent data store integration  
- 🔮 Self-learning hooks (for reinforcement and data-driven tuning)  
- ⚡ Lightweight FastAPI interface (optional)  
- 🧩 Extendable for Web4AI, RODAAI, and Fadaka Blockchain

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web4application/Brain.git
cd Brain
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt

🧰 Usage Example

from brain.core import BrainCore

brain = BrainCore()
response = brain.think("What is consciousness?")
print(response)

Output:

"Consciousness is the reflection of perception shaped by experience."

## 🧩 **ARCHITECTURE.md**
```markdown
# System Architecture — Brain AI Core

```

## 🧠 Overview
Brain is a cognitive framework organized around the principles of modular reasoning, data persistence, and adaptive learning.

It operates through four key layers:

1. **Core Layer (`brain/core/`)**  
   Handles reasoning, logic, and the execution of cognitive functions.

2. **Memory Layer (`brain/memory/`)**  
   Stores short-term and long-term knowledge, supporting key-value recall and contextual association.

3. **API Layer (`brain/api/`)**  
   Exposes an optional RESTful API (FastAPI-based) for programmatic access.

4. **Training Layer (`brain/train/`)**  
   Handles model updates, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

**Input → Reasoning Engine → Memory → Response → (Feedback → Retraining)**

---

## ⚙️ Technologies
- **Python 3.11+**
- **FastAPI** (optional API)
- **Redis / PostgreSQL** (optional for persistence)
- **NumPy / PyTorch** (for AI expansion)
- **Docker + GitHub Actions** (for deployment and CI/CD)

---

## 🧩 Scalability
Each layer is isolated and independently testable.  
Developers can extend the core with:
- New neural modules (`brain/core/modules/`)
- Custom memory adapters (e.g., Redis, SQLite)
- API routes (`brain/api/routes/`)

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
- Add agentic reasoning modules  
- Integrate RODAAI analytics  
- Expand training hooks for Web4AI

⚙️ API_REFERENCE.md

# API Reference — Brain

## 🧠 Core Module

### class BrainCore
Main reasoning engine of the Brain system.

**Methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `think(prompt: str) -> str` | Processes input and returns a cognitive response. |
| `remember(key: str, value: Any)` | Stores a piece of data in memory. |
| `recall(key: str) -> Any` | Retrieves stored information. |
| `train(data: dict)` | Triggers internal retraining or adaptation. |

---

## 💾 Memory Module

### class BrainMemory
Responsible for persistent and in-memory storage.

**Methods:**
- `save(key, value)`
- `load(key)`
- `flush()`

---

## 🌐 API Layer

If using FastAPI, the API exposes:

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/think` | POST | Sends a prompt to BrainCore and receives a response |
| `/remember` | POST | Saves data to memory |
| `/recall` | GET | Retrieves stored data |
