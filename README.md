# Brain Project Documentation

## Overview
**Brain** is a modular, bio-inspired artificial intelligence framework that integrates spiking neural networks, reinforcement learning, vision systems, and embedded microcontroller intelligence.

Developed by **Seriki Yakub (Web4application)**, Brain aims to emulate aspects of natural cognition, combining symbolic reasoning and neural architectures.

## Core Modules
| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Spiking | Bio-inspired neural computation |
| Vision | Computer vision & object recognition |
| RL | Reinforcement learning pipelines |
| Arduino | Embedded AI on microcontrollers |
| DB | Data storage and neural memory |
| Numerical | Mathematical utilities and computation |

## Features
- Modular AI subsystems
- Cross-platform (Python, Arduino, microcontrollers)
- Supports both symbolic and connectionist learning
- Scalable architecture for AI experimentation

## Getting Started
Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](guides/quick_start.md).
